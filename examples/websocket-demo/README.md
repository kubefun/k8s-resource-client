# websocket-demo

The purpose of the websocket-demo is to show an example of auto discovering namespaces and resources and establishing an event
triggered websocket message send for Pods, Deployments, and Replicasets.

As you watch the page, if you being to create, update, and delete any of these resources in your cluster, you will notice the counts
changing in real-time and the timestamp updating when those cluster events are fired.
